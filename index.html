                    Hello my name is Andrew Oh and I am a junior Computer Science Major studying at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html">Texas A&M University</a>. In my freetime I enjoy
                    playing video games, watching movies, and researching new technology. I am currently taking Intro to Computer System, Principles
                    of Statistics I, Game Design I, and Programming Studio. Currently, I am interested in AI and machine learning. I also have an interest
                    in game design/devlopment which is why I am pursuing a minor in game design at Texas A&M. As a whole, I am very passionate about new technology.
                    Recently, I have been trying to learn the different <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/business/teams.html?sdid=B16P3W9X&mv=search&ef_i

                    reative%20cloud!15482932269!136265038728&gad=1">Adobe Creative Cloud</a> Softwares such as Adobe Premiere. I often find myself 
                    losing track of time in my work. It's often very satisfying being an engineer and creating things inside and outside the classroom. Overall, I am excited to see
                    what the future holds for me.

                <p>
                    More on my interests, my favorite form of media is movies. I have always loved going to the cinema and watching movies with friends and family.
                    A few of my favorite movies of all time include Jaws, La La Land, and Taxi Driver. What I love about movies is how they are able to bring you
                    into a different world and end with a message for you to take away. Recently, my favorite director to watch has been David Fincher. I believe
                    the way he is able to create any situation into a nail biting scene is amazing. When it comes to my interest in technology, I love learning
                    about the newest bleeding edge tech that is released as well as the process in which these products are released. My favorite company of all
                    time is <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> due to how they are able to make waves within the tech world while also releasing beautifully designed products.
